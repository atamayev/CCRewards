Plan:
- Make the entire app local - no need for internet.
	Just enter cards, see rewards.
- Card list can be held in a json file in the app.
- Hold user cards in async storage

To-do:
- if a card is already added to the list, it should not be able to be added again.
-If the app is to be able to run locally, all the images will have to be downloaded and stored locally
-add these business cards:

Bugs:

Feature Additions:
Search:
	-Create a seperate search screen
	- Allow users to search for the best cards for a certain category (split it into general categories (ie groceries, travel), and specialty categroris (chase travel, southwest, etc.)
	- Allow users to filter by whatever parameters they want (more than 1% groceries & no annual fee, for example)
