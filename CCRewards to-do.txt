Plan:
- Make the entire app local - no need for internet.
	Just enter cards, see rewards.
- Card list can be held in a json file in the app.
- Hold user cards in async storage

To-do:
-If the app is to be able to run locally, all the images will have to be downloaded and stored locally
- find which cards offer expense reports
-add these business cards:

Bugs:

Feature Additions:
Search:
	- Allow users to search for the best cards for a certain category (split it into general categories (ie groceries, travel), and specialty categroris (chase travel, southwest, etc.)
	- Allow users to filter by whatever parameters they want (more than 1% groceries & no annual fee, for example)

Context:
	As soon as the app is open, load the user's credit card data into the context from async storage.
	Reading from context is faster than reading from async storage
