Plan:
- Make the entire app local - no need for internet.
	Just enter cards, see rewards.
- Card list can be held in a json file in the app.
- Hold user cards in async storage

To-do:
	-If the app is to be able to run locally, all the images will have to be downloaded and stored locally
	-add these business cards:
	https://www.americanexpress.com/us/credit-cards/business/business-credit-cards/?inav=footer_cards_bus_crdt_crd
	- Figure out adding a fallback image when the URI doesn't fetch data correctly (add-new-card, my-cards)

Bugs:
	- Make home screen scrollable, need to fix the styling/views
	- Scrolling over a button shouldn't activate that button
	
Feature Additions:
	My Rewards
		- Based on the user's existing cards, create a list of categories that the user qualifies for rewards, and display them
		- If two cards have the same reward, show that, and emphasize that teh user should use one card over the other
	Search:
		-Create a seperate search screen
		- Allow users to search for the best cards for a certain category (split it into general categories (ie groceries, travel), and specialty categroris (chase travel, southwest, etc.)
		- Allow users to filter by whatever parameters they want (more than 1% groceries & no annual fee, for example)
	Profile/Settings Screen:
		- Do you prefer points or cashback - for when 2X points vs 2% cashback for the same category
